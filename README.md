Run HEG-PreAssessment on your system before using **[HEG](https://github.com/conway87/HEG-3.0)** so you can:

- 📶 Determine logging levels of your Windows system across Security, Sysmon and PowerShell log files.
- 📚 Find which logging policies have been configured and which ones haven't.
- 🧭 Guide your roadmap to which policies should be configured next.
- ✅ Get detailed list of EventIDs and the associated event, see which ones your system can and cannot produce.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Know precisely which logs you are eligible for. 
- ⚠️ No log generated - means no log to SIEM - means no detection! ⚠️
